    Session Persistence
    Fastest Load Balancing Algorithm
    Anti Robot

Installation
============

Almost the same as original nginx installation, but use se-configure.sh to generate Makefile instead.
The se-configure.sh can also accept original configure.sh's parameters.

Example:
        ./se-configure.sh --prefix=/path/to/some/where
        make
        make install


Auto Test
=========

We have prepared a set of test cases in the test directory, use the auto-test.sh script to run all the test cases.

Example:
        cd test/
        ./auto-test.sh -s ./ -n /path/to/senginx/binary/file
